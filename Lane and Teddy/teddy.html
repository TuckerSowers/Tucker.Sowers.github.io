              <img src="resources/TeddyNewborn.JPG" alt="Teddy's birth picture" class="right">
              <p>In the womb, Teddy was a breech baby.  As luck would have it, a doctor in our practice was able to turn Teddy ninth months into the pregnancy (Mommy tried <em>everything</em> to flip Teddy but to no avail) and a few hours later (two minutes past midnight!), Teddy was born.</p>
              <p>Teddy loved to sleep.  Early on, much of this was due to sligher higher than normal levels of bilirubin in his system.  He was a bit of a jaundice baby, but totally healthy.  As Teddy started to wake up, he loved to watch his brother and stick things in his mouth.  Teddy's nanny was a nice woman named Dishani.  She would take Teddy to playdates, to Gymboree, and read to him.</p>

              <p>Teddy, like his brother, was quick to walk.  What's more, he was a bit of a bruiser.  Much to his credit, Teddy hardly ever got upset because of bumps or bruises.  More often he would just get up and keep going whether it be, cruising with his walker (better yet, let’s call it his crasher), chasing his dog, or exploring in the backyard.  Teddy’s vocabulary was somewhat limited between one and two, but his brother almost always seemed to know what he wanted.</p>

              <img src="resources/image1.JPG" alt="picture of teddy running" class="left">
              <p>Right around Teddy's second birthday, his vocabulary exploded.  He also began to go to Franklin Montessori in Ms. Wilson's class where he fast made friends with Benny, Ava, Eva, Beckett, and many others.  Of all of Teddy's activites, play-doh, painting, and stickers were probably his favorites.   Teddy was potty trained in the fall, which meant he got his "big boy bed."  By the end of the year, Teddy turned three.  He loved his construction-themed birthday party.</p>
